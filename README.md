#Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in excel.
No VBA scripting, only pure excel logic.

I built it in gnumeric, so please let me know if there are bugs in Microsoft Excel.

You can specify a starting pattern on tab Sheet2, 1 is live and 0 is dead. To initialize it, you have to change the value of A1 on Sheet3 to 0 and then back to 1 to be able to run the simulation.

You can watch the results on Sheet3. In order to run run the simulation you have to press f9, every two presses is one generation.


#Mandelbrot

This sheet generates the mandelbrot set. For each iteration, you have to change the value of A1 on the display tab to 0 and back to 1.
