Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in excel.
No VBA scripting, only pure excel logic.

I built it in gnumeric, so please let me know if there are bugs in Microsoft Excel.

You can specify a starting pattern on tab Sheet2, 1 is live and 0 is dead. To initialize it, you have to change the value of A1 on Sheet3 to 0 and then back to 1 to be able to run the simulation.

You can watch the results on Sheet3. In order to run run the simulation you have to press f9, every two presses is one generation.


Mandelbrot

This sheet generates the mandelbrot set using only pure spreadsheet logic, no VBA scripting or something whatsoever. For each iteration, you have to change the value of A1 on the display tab to 0 and back to 1. Set it to 2 to reset the sheet and when transferring it to another device/spreadsheet program, because some programs don't handle it well when the cells aren't on the default state

Logmap

When you make a scatter plot of the data, you will see the logmap graph.
